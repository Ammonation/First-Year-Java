## 5.1
I was required to complete the class called processMoney. In this class contained many methods that needed completing. Details on how to complete these methods where included in comments.
## 5.2
Within the class processMoney, there is a method called getNumCoins. When this is called it should return the number of each type of coin stored in the machine. Changes where needed to be made to some other methods to ensure this works properly.
