## 3.4

## 3.5
This application straightens the margins of text by adding additional spaces in-between words.

The user will enter the number of characters that are desired in each line and then will enter, line by line, the text to be aligned. Each line input must be shorter than the number of characters desired by the user. When the user enters the line "END", the application will return the text aligned.
