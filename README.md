# First-Year-Java
## Overview

This is a collection of Java code that I completed in the first year of my BSc(Hons) Computer Science degree. This repository should consist of 8 directories:
- Group 1 - Deals with very basic Java concepts
- Group 2 - Introduces logical problems and if/ else statements
- Group 3 - Deals with strings
- Group 4 - Introduces instances and objects
- Group 5 - Continues instances and objects
- Group 6 - First introduction of hash maps
- Mini Project 1 - Create an auto comment indenter
- Mini Project 2 - Create a version of the game "Breakout"

I am planning on creating more specific README.md files for each individual program.

*If you are a student completing similar tasks, please do not submit my code as your own, this will not help you learn how to code. My code should be used for inspiration only.*
