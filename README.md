# First-Year-Java
## Overview

This is a collection of Java code that I completed in the first year of my BSc(Hons) Computer Science degree. This repository should consist of 8 directories:
- [Group 1](https://github.com/Ammonation/First-Year-Java/tree/master/Group1) - Deals with very basic Java concepts
- [Group 2](https://github.com/Ammonation/First-Year-Java/tree/master/Group2) - Introduces logical problems and if/ else statements
- [Group 3](https://github.com/Ammonation/First-Year-Java/tree/master/Group3) - Deals with strings
- [Group 4](https://github.com/Ammonation/First-Year-Java/tree/master/Group4) - Introduces instances and objects
- [Group 5](https://github.com/Ammonation/First-Year-Java/tree/master/Group5) - Continues instances and objects
- [Group 6](https://github.com/Ammonation/First-Year-Java/tree/master/Group6) - First introduction of hash maps
- [Mini Project 1](https://github.com/Ammonation/First-Year-Java/tree/master/MiniProject1) - Create an auto comment indenter
- [Mini Project 2](https://github.com/Ammonation/First-Year-Java/tree/master/MiniProject2/Game) - Create a version of the game "Breakout"

I am planning on creating more specific README.md files for each individual program.

*If you are a student completing similar tasks, please do not submit my code as your own, this will not help you learn how to code. My code should be used for inspiration only.*
