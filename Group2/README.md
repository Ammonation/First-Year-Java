## 2.1
Allows the user to enter the student number, exam mark and coursework mark for a student. Summary data, including the average and if the student has passed or failed the module, will be output.
## 2.2
The user will enter a students name and the mark they received for an award. The system will then return the award the student should receive. i.e. 1st, 2.1, 2.2, 3rd, Fail.
## 2.3
Reads in a collection of data of a students performance in various aspects of a module.  It is then calculated if a student has either passed, failed or threshold failed the module.
## 2.4
Similarly to 1.4 and 1.5, this creates a square of "*.*", who's size is determined by the user. A diamond outline of "*\**" should appear in the square. Validation is used to ensure that the size of the square allows for a diamond to be output to the terminal successfully.
## 2.5
Calculates the minimum number of coins that would be given to a user from a certain amount of change. Coins include:
- £2
- £1
- 50p
- 20p
- 10p
- 5p
- 2p
- 1p

For example, if the user entered an amount of change of 201p, the system would return 1 £2 coin and 1 1p coin.
